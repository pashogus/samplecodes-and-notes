A bit confusion here, After the HTML self paced learning, we need to complete the JS course https://cognizant.udemy.com/course/es6-in-depth/   or DevOps course ?

Team - Next week, we will start Java Script. This will require knowledge of HTML, CSS as prerequisite.. So, please ensure that you complete the Udemy course on HTML, CSS (https://cognizant.udemy.com/course/web-design-for-beginners-real-world-coding-in-html-css/) before our next session (on Wednesday)
In addition, please ensure that you go through the Udemy course on DevOps (https://cognizant.udemy.com/course/the-devops-essentials/) .. it is just a 2 hours course.. This will help you to relate to what was discussed on last Wednesday session..
Have a good weekend and see you in the Java Script session next week..
